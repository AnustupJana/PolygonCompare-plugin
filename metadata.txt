about=The Polygon Compare plugin is a robust tool for QGIS users to analyze changes between two vector polygon layers. By comparing a unique ID field and polygon geometries, it identifies added polygons (new features in the second layer), deleted polygons (features absent in the second layer), and modified polygons (features with the same ID but changed geometry). The plugin outputs three separate layers for easy visualization and analysis, making it invaluable for tasks like land use change detection, parcel compare, footprint compare, urban planning, environmental monitoring, or any GIS workflow tracking spatial updates. With error handling for invalid geometries and detailed processing feedback, Polygon Compare ensures reliable results. Simplify your change detection tasks with this intuitive and efficient plugin, designed to enhance spatial data analysis in QGIS.
